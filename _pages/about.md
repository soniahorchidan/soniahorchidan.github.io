<br>

I am a Doctoral Student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, where I am part of the Division of Software and Computer Systems (SCS) of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I am supervised by Prof. [Jim Dowling](https://www.kth.se/profile/jdowling), Prof. [Seif Haridi](https://www.kth.se/profile/haridi), Prof. [Henrik Bostr√∂m](https://www.kth.se/profile/henbos), and Asst. Prof. [Paris Carbone](https://www.kth.se/profile/parisc).

My research is tightly intertwined with the [Continuous Deep Analytics](https://cda-group.github.io/) (CDA) project, whose purpose is to build the foundations of next-generation scalable Big Data platforms that can make real-time decisions based on massive live data. In this project, I focus on systems for Graph Data Management and large-scale Graph Analytics. More specifically, I investigate how Graph Representation Learning can be leveraged to solve graph data management problems.

My research focuses on <b>Large Graph Analytics</b>, <b>Graph Representation Learning</b>, and <b>Stream Processing</b>.

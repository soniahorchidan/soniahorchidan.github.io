<br>

I am a first-year Doctoral Student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, where I am part of the Division of Software and Computer Systems (SCS) of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I am supervised by Prof. [Jim Dowling](https://www.kth.se/profile/jdowling), Prof. [Seif Haridi](https://www.kth.se/profile/haridi), Prof. [Henrik Bostr√∂m](https://www.kth.se/profile/henbos), and Asst. Prof. [Paris Carbone](https://www.kth.se/profile/parisc).

My research is tightly intertwined with the [Continuous Deep Analytics](https://cda-group.github.io/) (CDA) project, whose purpose is to build the foundations of next-generation scalable Big Data platforms that can make real-time decisions based on massive live data. In this project, I will investigate and develop Machine Learning algorithms and applications that process large, dynamic graphs.

My research focuses on <b>Streaming Computation</b>, <b>Machine Learning on Graphs</b>, and <b>Distributed Graph Processing Systems</b>.

I am a Doctoral Student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, where I am part of the Division of Software and Computer Systems (SCS) of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). My supervisors are Asst. Prof. [Paris Carbone](https://www.kth.se/profile/parisc), Prof. [Jim Dowling](https://www.kth.se/profile/jdowling), Prof. [Seif Haridi](https://www.kth.se/profile/haridi), and Prof. [Henrik Bostr√∂m](https://www.kth.se/profile/henbos).

My research focuses on <b>Graph Databases</b>, <b>Graph Machine Learning</b>, and <b>Stream Processing</b>. Specifically, my work attempts to enable a new research direction for enabling approximate query processing in Graph Databases via Machine Learning inference.

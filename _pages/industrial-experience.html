I was part of the Audio team for Google Duo and Google Meet. I worked on a project meant to investigate the applicability and efficiency of WebAssembly when it comes to real-time audio processing. I compiled an existing computationally heavy C++ module to WebAssembly, in order to be used as part of the web page, instead of as part of the browser. I developed proof-of-concept demo pages, showcasing the results, using C++, JavaScript and, TypeScript.

I have written Bash and Python scripts for internal usage with the aim of streamlining the development process. One example of such task was to efficiently extract information from large data files. I have also worked on load testing the system using JMeter.
